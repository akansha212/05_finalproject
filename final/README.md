Problem of Existing System book issue system

The existing system to request for book issue and return is dependent upon he one who issues book. If the student totally forgets about which book he got issued then the fine me get charged over him in due time.
 Hence the data stored at librarian side only is not enough and hence we want to give some kind of notification to student also.

Remedy by Proposed System

This project is aimed at developing software that is of importance to library. Whenever a book will get issued by a student he/she will receive a message saying you have issued this book also before his return date a message will be generated saying you need to return this book



he project is not complete yet,i need to send a message to student who get the book issued but i am not able to find any
website that provides this facility for free.
